## The Dorothy Hodgkin Prize

The Dorothy Hodgkin Prize of the BCA was instituted in 1990 on the occasion of Dorothy’s 80th birthday, in recognition of her great contributions to science in general and to crystallography in particular. The Prize is supported by donations to the Dorothy Hodgkin Prize Fund which is a Restricted Fund of the BCA.

Nominations for this prize are welcomed from any part of the crystallographic community and the award will be made at a BCA Spring Meeting at which the awardee is expected to deliver a suitable Lecture. Awardees generally work in an area of crystallography in which Dorothy had an interest, and may have worked either with Dorothy or with one of her students.

## The Bragg Lecture

The BCA is proud to have hosted many recent Bragg Lectures. Lecturers are chosen by the Bragg Lecture Fund Committee approximately every three years and the lecture is one of the highlights of the British Crystallographic Association Spring Meeting programme. The current Bragg Committee (mid-2013) is: Professor Richard Catlow FRS, Department of Chemistry and Head of the MAPS Faculty, UCL; Professor Frank James Professor of the History of Science and Head of Collections, The Royal Institution; Professor Elspeth Garman, Professor of Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford. The Bragg Committee are happy to receive suggestions for future Bragg Lecturers via the BCA.

## The Lonsdale Lecture

In 1985 the Bragg Lecture Fund Committee considered whether they should organize a memorial lecture for Kathleen Lonsdale. They decided it would be inappropriate for them to do it; instead they recommended that the British Crystallographic Association approach the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) about a possible annual Lonsdale Lecture, at which young people would hear about crystallography. These were held for a few years, but attracted a very small audience. The BCA Council therefore decided to move the Lonsdale lecture to take place during the BCA Annual Meeting.

The September 1986 issue of Crystallography News page 5 reported that the BCA Council had decided to inaugurate a series of annual lectures to commemmorate the work of the late Dame Kathleen Lonsdale. The December 1987 issue on page 7 records that the 1st Lonsdale lecture was given by our BCA President David Blow.

Recently, the Lonsdale Lecture is awarded by the BCA on the recommendation of the Young Crystallographers Group. The range of topics encompass all areas of crystallography and diffraction and the lectures tend to have an element of teaching.

## The BCA Prize Lecture

The BCA Prize Lecture is awarded triennially. The awardee will be someone who has made a notable contribution to scientific research in which crystallography has played a central role. Nominations are welcomed from any part of the crystallographic community and should be sent by email to the BCA President (president@crystallography.org.uk) together with a short (&lt; 500 words) case supporting the nomination. The lecture will be awarded in 2019 and then in 2022 with a nomination deadline in early 2021.
